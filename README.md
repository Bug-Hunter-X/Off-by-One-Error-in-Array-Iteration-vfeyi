# Off-by-One Error in Java Array
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays.  The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition, attempting to access an index that is out of bounds.  The solution demonstrates a corrected loop condition to avoid the exception.

**Bug:** The original code has a loop that iterates one element past the valid index range of the array, resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

**Solution:** The solution demonstrates the correct loop condition to fix the off-by-one error.
